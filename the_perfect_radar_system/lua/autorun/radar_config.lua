	-- You are 10MPH above the speed limit, which means it's 2* the value Diablos.RS.MoneyMoreSpeed you set. Since Diablos.RS.MoneyAdded is set to 0.2, 
	-- it means that you pay 0.2*fine price = 0.2*100 = $20 more and since you are 2*Diablos.RS.MoneyMoreSpeed above the speed limit, you'll pay 2*20=$40 
	-- plus the initial fine price which is $100 so you'll pay $140 total. If you are 15MPH above the speed limit it will be $160 total and so on.
